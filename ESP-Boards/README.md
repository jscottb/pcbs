<b>The RoboESP32</b><br>
The RoboESP uses the Wroom-32, wide or narrow versions. The motors are on GPIO26 & 27 (Left) and GPIO32 & 33 (Right)<br>
There's a connector for a HC-SR04 and it's on GPIO4 (Trigger) and GPIO2 (Echo). The Echo is tried in via a voltage divider for allowing a normal 5v version of the HC-SR04 to be used.<br>
The voltage regulator space is for an 1117 LDO type, at 5v/1a.<br>
