ESP-Boards

Getting PCBs manufactured:

Just download the zip file from this site for the PCB you want and upload that file to the PCB makers site of your choice and enter the size info if needed included below for the board you want to have manufactured.

<b>The RoboESP32</b><br>
The RoboESP uses the Wroom-32, wide or narrow versions. The motors are on GPIO26 & 27 (Left) and GPIO32 & 33 (Right)<br>
There's a connector for a HC-SR04 and it's on GPIO4 (Trigger) and GPIO2 (Echo). The Echo is tried in via a voltage divider for allowing a normal 5v version of the HC-SR04 to be used.<br>
The voltage regulator space is for an 1117 LDO type, at 5v/1a. The output of the regulator powers the ESP and the "V" pin headers.<br>

<b>The Wroom-32 BRK</b><br>
The Wroom-32 BRK uses the Wroom-32, wide or narrow versions. There's support for a .91" OLED display and 3 pushbuttons for Menu control, etc. The buttons are on GPIO4 (Sel), GPIO17 (DN), and GPIO5 (UP).<br>
A location is included for a logic level converter for I2C (3.3v to 5V). It also has 2 I2C headers.<br>
The voltage regulator space is for an 1117 LDO type, at 5v/1a. The output of the regulator powers the ESP and the "V" pin headers.<br>
