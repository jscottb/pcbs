# Naan Breadboard like PCBs
<b>Story:<br>

I love to tinker with electronics and love to solder!  After buying some of the commercially available proto boards I found that the good ones are kind of expensive in any number past just a few and the inexpensive ones are terrible in quality and still require a lot of extra work soldering and running wires that could be eliminated.  There were also a few things I wanted to have with proto boards, like more size options, more connected row holes, and a smaller footprint with little wasted space. Most of all, I wanted good BB like PCBs that were cheap to have made and that I could keep more than just a few on hand in different sizes.  Enter the Naan boards...</b><br>

Simple layouts for breadboard like PCBs I use.  They are inexpensive to have made by most of the modern off-shore PCB houses. 
Usually, it cost around 13$USD for 10 boards to be made and shipped, <b>and it's sometimes cheaper if it's your first time ordering</b>. Having them made for yourself should be much cheaper than many of the pre-made BB like PCBs offered by others and the quality will be much better. You could do first time orders from several houses and get a lot PCBs for less money ;)

The XLRG Naan will run about 13$USD shipped for 5 boards.  It's almost 10cm x 2 in size. 

Note: Some PCB makers have the size cap at 50mm before the price goes up per board. PCBWay and other manufacturers are currently 100mm before the per board increase. Always check as you enter the board info on the sellers site.

See the png files for what the boards look like. Note that the half-naan's lettering is wrong on the image but has been corrected in the gerbers included in the zip file.

<u><b>Getting PCBs manufactured:</b></u><br>

Just download the zip file from this site for the PCB you want and upload that file to the PCB manufacturers site of your choice and enter the size info if needed included below for the board you want to have manufactured.

<u>Board sizes:</u>

tiny-naan-single  W: 22mm   x H: 48mm - Single board gerber of the tiny-naan - 128 linked holes<br>
tiny-naan (pre-panelized)  W: 22mm   x H: 48mm on a sheet that is 89mm x 96mm with 8 on it - 128 linked holes<br>
micro-naan W: 36.4mm x H: 38.7mm - Single-sided - 180 linked holes - very cheap to do as a 2x3 board panel<br>
<b>NOTE: There are Double sided versions of the Tiny and Micro Naans now.  Zip files will have DBL in the file name.</b><br><br>
lil-naan   W: 41.5mm x H: 46.7mm - 180 linked holes + power rails and some extra non-linked<br>
Naan-Jr    W: 32mm x H: 52mm -     240 linked holes + center power rail<br>
Half-naan  W: 53.4mm x H: 70.9mm - 288 linked holes + power rails and some extra non-linked<br>
Naan-V8 W: 57mm x H: 72mm - 384 linked holes + power rails and some extra non-linked<br>
Naan       W: 56mm   x H: 96mm   - 408 linked holes + power rails and some extra non-linked<br>
Xlrg-naan  W: 99.3   x H: 96.9   - 816 linked holes + power rails and extra non-linked<br>

Old Half-naan W: 58mm x H: 73mm <br>

Most naan boards have 6 holes per strip side instead of the normal 5 found on most breadboards. I find having 6 helps with larger parts and extra room. The lil-naan is the only exception having just 5, but with added power rails. The tiny-naan has 8 and is made for a lot of support components for 555 and power regulator circuits or other small chip designs, like microcontrollers.  The lil-naan and Naan-Jr can be panelized by the PCB manufacturer for a reasonable cost.<br>
